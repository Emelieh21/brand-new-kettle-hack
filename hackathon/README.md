# Teabot
### By Team _Brand New Kettle-hack_

*A fun weekend project by Emelie Hofland and Jaime González-Arintero. Created during the [Intel IoT Solutions Hackathon in Fürth](https://iotevents.intel.com/Furth2017/), on March 11 - 12, 2017.*

## Hackathon Project Info

As said, this project was created during a hackathon, but some of the media and resources on this repository are not specifically required to replicate the setup.

For example, the solution used at the hackathon involved some additional building blocks, like an [Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE gateway](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-kit-de3815tykhe-board-de3815tybe.html). Thus, the architecture diagram shown here is slightly different. Aside from that, some pictures of the presentation have been added below. Good memories! :)
