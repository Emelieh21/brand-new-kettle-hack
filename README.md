### By Team _Brand New Kettle-hack_

*A fun weekend project by Emelie Hofland and Jaime González-Arintero. Created during the [Intel IoT Solutions Hackathon in Fürth](https://iotevents.intel.com/Furth2017/), on March 11 - 12, 2017.*

## Introduction

After **months** of extensive market research, we discovered that **no-one ever** hacked a kettle before.

Okay, this may not be _fully_ true. There are _a few_ Internet-connected kettles out there. But hey, never enough!

These docs are a **work in progress**, come back soon for more *swag*.

Meanwhile, you can listen to the song that inspired us...

## Requirements

The following hardware is required:

* Electric jug kettle. For this project we used an affordable model from the brand Tristar, like [this one](http://www.tristar.eu/en/Home_Appliances/Breakfast___Brunch/Jug_Kettles/WK-1337/3/6669).
* [Intel® Edison Arduino Breakout Kit](https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/IntelEdison#toc3)
* 3-5V / 230V relay module (like [this Grove one](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Relay-p-769.html)). For this project we used the [relay shield for the WeMos D1 mini](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Relay-Shield-for-WeMos-D1-mini-button/1331105_32596395175.html?spm=2114.12010608.0.0.JXGY1P).
* Assorted jumper wires.
* Cable cutter.
* Small flathead screwdriver.

A computer is required to connect the Edison board for flashing and configuration.
