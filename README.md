*A fun weekend project by Emelie Hofland and Jaime González-Arintero. Created during the [Intel IoT Solutions Hackathon in Fürth](https://iotevents.intel.com/Furth2017/), on March 11 - 12, 2017.*

## Introduction

After **months** of extensive market research, we discovered that **no-one ever** hacked a kettle before.
